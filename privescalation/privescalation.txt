- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
There should have the session ID and userID can use to be hacker control, however is missing now. 
We need to make sure the API sould be protected using 
middleware(app.use). 
The userID should be validated by session.
check if userID is in the session and if the user is 
allowed for access

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
secure the session more, the session id should not be spoof, 
by setting cookie to httpOnly to true and sameSite to true.
Dont rely only on the session, send additional token to 
the client, then the client parse it.
